## _Passing code with behavior parameterization_



## Sections

- 2.1: Coping with changing requirements
- 2.2. Behavior parameterization
- 2.3. Tackling verbosity
- 2.4. Real-world examples

## Summary:
- Behavior parameterization is the ability for a method to take multiple different behaviors as parameters and use them internally to accomplish different behaviors.
- Behavior parameterization lets you make your code more adaptive to changing requirements and saves on engineering efforts in the future.
- Passing code is a way to give new behaviors as arguments to a method. But itâ€™s verbose prior to Java 8. Anonymous classes helped a bit before Java 8 to get rid of the verbosity associated with declaring multiple concrete classes for an interface that are needed only once.
- The Java API contains many methods that can be parameterized with different behaviors, which include sorting, threads, and GUI handling.
